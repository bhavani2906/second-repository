 1.An Elastic Block Storage (EBS) Volume hosts virtual data in segments. 
   It's like a storage disk with the ability to contain various sizes of data.
   These virtual storage devices usually replicate within one AWS region to increase their availability.
2. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
   EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances.


                FIRST METHOD
 >create an ec2 instance in an availabilityzone 
 >default volume will be created for this 
 >create a snapshot from that volume
 >now create second instance in same availability zone for that default volume will be created
 >now attach a volume which is created by snapshot to second instance
 >now stop second instance and detach the default root volume and attached snapshot volume
 >now again attach the volume created from snapshot to second instance as root volume by replacing device name as xvda 
 >now start the second instance and check the files

                         SECOND METHOD 
>while creating an instance add an ebs volume and copy the snapshot and launch instance
>now give ll and check the files (from snapshot volume )
> create some files and give ll (all files will combine and come)
